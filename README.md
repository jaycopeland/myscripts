# myscripts
This is my collection of import scripts for importing data into lincs-omero. 
Most of these are written for specific situations and are not generally 
re-usable. As such, they are a starting point and will need work to make
them generally usable. That will have to wait until we have the permissions 
worked out as to who can run these.
